🚀 Multi-Agent AI System using Google ADK
This project demonstrates a modular Multi-Agent System capable of processing natural language goals by delegating tasks across specialized agents. Powered by Google ADK, it showcases autonomous planning, API integration, and real-time decision making.

🧠 Example Goal
“Find the next SpaceX launch, check weather at that location, and determine if it may be delayed.”

The system intelligently decomposes the above goal, coordinates between agents, and generates a concise final summary.

🧩 Agent Architecture
Agent Name	Responsibility
🧠 PlannerAgent	Breaks down the user's goal into actionable tasks.
🚀 LaunchInfoAgent	Retrieves upcoming SpaceX launch data via the SpaceX API.
☁️ WeatherAgent	Uses coordinates to fetch weather conditions from OpenWeatherMap.
⚠️ DelayAssessmentAgent	Assesses the possibility of launch delay based on weather conditions.

🔧 Setup Instructions

Goal: Find the next SpaceX launch, check weather at that location, and determine if it may be delayed.

[PlannerAgent] Breaking down goal into tasks...
[LaunchInfoAgent] Fetching next SpaceX launch details...
  -> Launch: Galaxy 33 & 34 at CCSFS SLC 40 on 2022-10-08T23:05:00.000Z
[WeatherAgent] Fetching weather at launch site...
  -> Weather: scattered clouds, Temp: 28°C, Wind: 4.44 m/s
[DelayAssessmentAgent] Analyzing conditions for possible delay...

Final Output:
Launch: Galaxy 33 & 34 at CCSFS SLC 40  
Date: 2022-10-08T23:05:00.000Z  
Weather: scattered clouds with 4.44 m/s wind  
Delay Risk: UNLIKELY
